I ask the Xpert Learning Assistant the following questions:
* Javascript for loop to go through a json dictionary and get the keys and values
* How to fix the syntax of: for (let key in sampleMetaData){ console.log(`${key}: ${sampleMetaData[key]}`) }
* Syntax to create a bubble chart in Javascript
* Access the first object directly of the array used for the bubble chart
* How to combine the arrays to then plot the top 10 ids with their corresponding value
* How to style the HTML for .card-header
